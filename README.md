# Zoho_Assignments_By_Jois_Prabhanjan

<b>Hi I am Prabhanjan jois, I'm currently pursuing Computer Science Engineering at SDM Institute of technology, Ujire [Karnataka] in final year.</b>
<b>I have been delighted to get selected for the second programming round in zoho and found those assignment questions intersting.</b>
<b>There were 3 assignments given and was mentioned that any one could be selected and worked on.</b>
<b>But I have worked on 2 assignments:</b>
* 1 Contacts application.
* 2 Ball Brick game
