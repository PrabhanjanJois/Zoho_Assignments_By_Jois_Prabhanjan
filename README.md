# Zoho_Assignments_By_Jois_Prabhanjan

Hi I am Prabhanjan jois, I'm currently pursuing Computer Science Engineering at SDM Institute of technology, Ujire [Karnataka] in final year.\
I have been delighted to get selected for the <b>ZOHO's</b> second programming round in zoho and found those assignment questions intersting.\
\
There were 3 assignments given and was mentioned that any one could be selected and worked on.\
But I have worked on 2 assignments:
* 1 Contacts application.
* 2 Ball Brick game.
\
\
<b>1) Contacts Application</b>
\
This web-based application was developed using PHP, MySQL Database, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application has a pleasant user interface and is easy to use. The system requires system users' credentials to access the list of the phone books or directories and other features of the application. The new user can create a new system account by registering their credentials.
