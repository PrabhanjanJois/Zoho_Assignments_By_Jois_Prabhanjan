# Zoho_Assignments_By_Jois_Prabhanjan

Hi I am Prabhanjan jois, I'm currently pursuing Computer Science Engineering at SDM Institute of technology, Ujire [Karnataka] in final year.\
I have been delighted to get selected for the <b>ZOHO's</b> second programming round in zoho and found those assignment questions intersting.\
\
There were 3 assignments given and was mentioned that any one could be selected and worked on.\
But I have worked on 2 assignments:
* 1 Contacts application.
* 2 Ball Brick game.

# <b>1) Contacts Application</b>

This web-based application was developed using PHP, MySQL Database, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. \
The application has a pleasant user interface and is easy to use. \
The system requires system users' credentials to access the list of the phone books or directories and other features of the application.\
The new user can create a new system account by registering their credentials.

# <b>2) Ball Brick game</b>

Ball brick is a game where there will be a ball at the ground level and with that ball you have to destroy all the bricks above it.\
For each hit the bricks will come closer to ground level. When the ball touches the ground then you lose GAME OVER..!!\
If you destroy all the bricks before the bricks touches the ground then you win HURRAY..!!\
This program was developed in <b>Jupyter Notebook</b> by using Python language.
*******************************************************************************
<b> Insturctions :</b>
*******************************************************************************
* Consider the game in a NxN Matrix.The first ball starts from the middle of the bottom most row of the matrix.
* The ball can traverse in three directions.Straight(ST), Left Diagonal(LD) and Right Diagonal(RD).
* The user has to enter the direction in which the ball has to traverse.
* After getting the input from the user the ball will traverse in that direction and hit the brick/wall on its way.
* The bricks can be arranged in any manner and the bricks strength will be denoted by a number.
